Atom To Byte took the responsibility to preach and propagate the knowledge and education beyond the four walls of the classes and thus ultimately making education accessable and ubiquitous.<br>This could be done by bridging the gaps between the privileged and under- privileged sections of the society. Our core team members, up took the task to write modules on various topics of computer and its basics. The language used is lucid and easily understandable. The core team has followed a decent paradigm to write the module. These modules are then distributed for free all over the country to the needy and curious ones. Also, the module has been made available on the website, so anyone can download it to learn or propagate.
